# CrunchyDL
Crunchyroll Downloader heavily inspired by CR-Unblocker for Google Chrome (also uses the same server).
New version fixes problem with Crunchyroll apparently using captchas now.
### TODO:
- find a way to download fragments for mpeg-dash video (maybe use different library like selenium-requests?)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x with pycryptodome, selenium (Chrome) and requests
- ffmpeg.exe in the same folder as the Python script

## Usage
No instructions required, it's self-explanatory (new version not so much, but you just have to change three variables at the start of the script)

# CrunchyDL
Crunchyroll Downloader heavily inspired by the CR-Unblocker for Google Chrome (also uses the same server)

## Requirements
 - Python 3.x with pycryptodome

## Usage
Run the script, enter your username, password and the URL of the episode that you wanna download (f.e. https://www.crunchyroll.com/konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world/episode-4-explosion-magic-for-this-formidable-enemy-692399). Then just select the audio and subtitle language (actually there's only one audio language per episode, so I don't even know why I didn't just leave that out) and finally the resolution (the same resolution can apper multiple times due to there being multiple mirrors).
